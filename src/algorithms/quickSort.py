The quickSortRec function is a recursive implementation of the QuickSort algorithm.

QuickSort is an efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. 
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the remaining elements into two sub-arrays: those smaller than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts these sub-arrays.

### How to Use:
- Call the `quickSortRec` function, passing in an array of integers that you want to sort.
- The function will return a sorted version of the input array.

### Notes:
- The algorithm's time complexity is O(n log n) on average but can degrade to O(nÂ²) in the worst case if a poor pivot is chosen repeatedly (e.g., when the input array is already sorted).
- This implementation uses the middle-left element as the pivot, which helps in balancing the partitioning.
- The algorithm handles duplicates by placing equal elements in a separate `equal` array, ensuring stability.
